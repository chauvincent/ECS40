* Each of our functions for VectorList and LinkedList works fine.

* We tested our functions by extending main and adding more options to the menu. In addition, we created a "func" and "predicate" function, which we made to increment 1 for map and either always return true or false for testing our filter.

* For shared, our classmates on piazza are declaring their l2 with type <int>. However, we found it causing errors because we declared out l2 inside our case functions which is suppose to compare <int> and also <double> so we used the template type T to test our shared function for both LinkedList and VectorList to avoid cross instatiation errors of int and double, and it works fine.

* We posted to piazza and also referred to our classmate's posts.

* We used stackoverflow for algorithms on sorting, and reversing, and implemented their algorithms into our program.
