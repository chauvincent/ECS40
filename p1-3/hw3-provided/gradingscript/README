To run, point to the directory containing your source files.  Make sure the script is executable first.

$ chmod a+x ./grade.sh
$ ./grade.sh <directory-containing-mscp.cpp>

e.g. for the reference program:
$ ./grade.sh ../handin/reference

Reference output is stored in 'ref.out'.  Output from your version will be in 'out'.  To see the differences, use diff:

$ diff -u ref.out out
