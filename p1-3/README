Our code compiles and runs fine. All the outputs match the reference 
provided with the gradescipt.
	
Changes made:

1. We first separated all the inline functions and const variables into board.h because
   both board.cpp and mscp.cpp will be using those same functions and declarations.
   
2. We replace the sscanf's with by using istringstream(from stackoverflow). 

3. We declared a class Board inside board.h. Then made a constructor that allocated 
   a private variable for the boardSize of 67. 

4. We declared overloaded subscript operator inside our class, and redeclared board as bboard
   inside mscp.cpp.

5. We moved setup_board, print_board, compute_hash, and reset into our Board class 
   as public member functions. Because we drew a diagram of all the function calls and those function
   were responsible for manipulating the board(execept for the moves).

6. We changed the static declarations such as undo_stack, move_stack, and etc into extern. 
   We redeclared the variables inside mscp.cpp.

7. We changed ply to extern because it is responsible for deciding white/black's turn.

8. We had also had help from our awesome TA, Saheel. We were having undefined references to 
   our hw3, and Saheel helped us resolve the problem with the makefile(we did not include the .o's before).
